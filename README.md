COVID ETL Project v2 - Frontend Repository

---

WIP

This is the frontend dashboard for my Covid-19 ETL Project. The dashboard will be a Streamlit app authored in Python 
and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance.

This repository will also handle infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and automated CI/CD.

_Dev roadmap: June 20_
* Began developing the Streamlit app locally by loading data using Pandas
* Once the app is polished, the backend (a separate repo) will be developed, mostly from scratch but referencing the 
first iteration of this project
* When the backend is functional, the Streamlit app will be refactored to pull data from a DynamoDB instance and will 
then be ready for deployment
